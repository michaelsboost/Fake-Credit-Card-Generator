WHAT DO VISA/DISCOVER/ETC CARDS START WITH?
----------------------------------------------------------

Visa credit card numbers start with the number 4. Each credit card has a unique string of numbers, but the first one or two digits can help you identify the payment network.

A Discover card's first digit is the number 6, Mastercard’s is 5, and American Express card numbers start with 3.

When combined with the first digit, the next 5 digits of a credit card number identify the card issuer for any given Visa. The subsequent 8 numbers are part of your account number. These numbers make the card unique to the cardholder. Finally, the last digit is a security measure. It helps verify that the other numbers aren’t entered incorrectly. In total, Visa cards have 16 digits spaced into groups of 4.
